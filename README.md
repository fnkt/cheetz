Here is cheetz. I developed this bookmarklet for cheating in school. It acesses the website noowai.com in a window that is small enough to use on a test and it can be resizes and quickly closed. The reason for usin a bookmarklet is that it can be used on a chromebook because the chromebooks we use at school are completely restricted to only do what our school wants us to do exept for javascript which is the only flaw as far as im concerned.
It doesnt appear on the history and can therfore be used in a test with relative confidence you wont be caught unless your teachers are super smart and use nsa grade tools to litterally spy on their students in which case it is probably too late by even just looking at this site but it is unlikely.

In v2 i added the function of disguising as a calculator so if you are asked to open the bookmarklet it will just show a fully functional calculator. The passcode is "7913".
All you do is you click the version you want and copy all the code into your bookmarks bar. if you cant see it press ctrl+shift+b. you can rename it by right clicking the bookmarklet and pressing "edit"
